      ## 2 - Triangle
    program finds area and perimeter of a triangle given three sides
    all the requirements are completed
    program tested at least 49 times
    grade: 110/100

'''
- get three sides for the triangle
- tests if the three sides actually form a triangle
- onverts it to float
- Finds half the perimeter
- the area
- prints the area of the triangle
